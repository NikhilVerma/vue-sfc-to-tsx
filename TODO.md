# TODO

Known limitations and future work.

## Planned

- Better handling of complex dynamic class bindings (e.g. nested ternaries, array syntax with mixed types)
- Support for `<style module>` (named CSS modules)
- Improved custom directive conversion (v-custom-directive with complex arguments)
- Vue 2 compatibility mode
- Source map generation
- Watch mode for CLI
- Plugin system for custom transforms
